    <h2>A History of Eggs</h2>
    <p>The young of most animals grow from eggs. Only female animals make eggs. Male animals make cells called sperm. A sperm must join an egg before the egg can grow into a new animal.</p>
    <p>In most mammals, the egg is just a cell, called an ovum, inside the motherâ€™s body. A sperm cell joins with the egg cell in a process called fertilization. The fertilized egg grows and develops inside the mother until the baby is ready to be born.</p>
